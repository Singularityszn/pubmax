# Mutating API surface certification

Wave 0 treats every exported `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` handler as a
reviewed surface—even when a POST is semantically read-only. The regression test
`__tests__/writeSurfaceCertification.test.ts` scans the complete `app/api` tree.
Adding a sixty-first mutating route or removing its authority/abuse boundary fails
CI until this certification is deliberately updated.

## Boundary classes

| Boundary | Purpose | Representative surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| Durable rate limit | Public/keyless abuse and provider-cost control | Events, discovery proxies, Pint Drops, crawl contributions, Plan creation |
| Account | Supabase-authenticated ownership | Night Memories/Stories, Pub Pal, profiles, social connections |
| Capability | Narrow possession-based authority plus server validation | Plan actions, completion, invites, constraints, proposals, recap |
| Moderator | Staff-only operational mutation | Import notes and moderation |
| Confirmation | One-use confirmation for a consequential proposal | Night Story publication |

These boundaries compose. For example, Plan creation is rate-limited and fails
closed when durable enforcement is unavailable; later lifecycle writes require a
Plan member capability and use idempotency keys or atomic store operations.

## Failure posture

- Anonymous paid spend (`concierge`, narrated `heritage`) and Plan creation pass
  `{ failClosed: true }` to the durable limiter.
- Keyless local development remains usable through the bounded process-local
  limiter when Supabase is not configured.
- Public community contribution paths use durable limits in production and a
  tightened degraded budget on transient limiter failures.
- Account, moderator, and Plan-capability routes reject missing authority before
  persistence. Confirmation-protected publication requires a separate one-use
  token.
- Read-only discovery remains available with caching and abuse controls; it never
  receives a write capability merely because the HTTP verb is POST.

## Certification command

```bash
npx vitest run __tests__/writeSurfaceCertification.test.ts __tests__/rateLimit.test.ts
```

## Production evidence — 17 July 2026

- The production `check_rate_limit` RPC returned `false`, `false`, then `true` for
  three sequential hits against a limit of two. The disposable certification row
  was removed immediately afterward.
- Both Vercel production projects, `chengdu` and `pubmax`, contain the required
  `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `RATE_LIMIT_SALT`, and `ADMIN_TOKEN`
  variable definitions. Values are sensitive and are never printed or committed.
- Route and limiter tests prove the fail-closed option returns the documented 429
  path before a Plan or paid-provider request proceeds.

The structural scan, live atomic-limiter check, and deployment configuration must
all remain green. A future route added without a reviewed boundary fails the closed
inventory count and boundary assertions in CI.
