// (see lib/profileOwnership.ts + app/api/profiles/[handle]/route.ts).
//
// A request proves identity by sending its Supabase access token as
// `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`. We verify it by asking Supabase who it belongs
// to (auth.getUser(jwt)) using the admin client — this validates the signature +
// expiry server-side, so a forged/expired token yields null (anonymous), never a
// trusted uid. NEVER trust a uid sent in the body/query; only a verified token.
