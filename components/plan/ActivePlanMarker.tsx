// /plan link has no capability yet, so nothing is marked and Night Mode never
// ambushes their join flow. An accepted mate does get Night Mode — joining
// writes the same capability event (role "guest") the host gets at creation
// (role "host"), so a mate who joins mid-visit picks this up live, no reload.
