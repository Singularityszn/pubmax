-- Rollback for 0151. It restores 0150's tombstone trigger, then drops the
-- sender-profile stamp, its trigger and its column.
--
-- WHAT THIS COSTS, said plainly: review finding F-4 comes back. Account
-- deletion joins messages on the CURRENT handle again, so an account that has
-- ever renamed leaves the photos it sent under an older handle in the bucket,
-- with `attachment_object_key` still naming them and the other participant
-- still able to fetch them. Nothing a person wrote is lost, and re-applying the
-- forward file re-derives every stamp from `profile_handle_aliases`, which is
-- where the answer actually lives.
--
-- Run it only to take the forward file back off a cluster it should not be on.
